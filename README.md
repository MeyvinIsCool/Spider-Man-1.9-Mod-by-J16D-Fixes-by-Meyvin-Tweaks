- Remade Screwball Trigger Now With 3D Blips - GTA3Script 
- Restored Screwball PhotoBomb Challange (This Is Still Ment To Create For 1080p Resolution , Sadly Using Other Resolution Will Make The Bar Overlap....But I Managed To   Fix That For 720p Resolution Too ....Use These Files From The "Use This If You Are Using 720p Resolution" Folder To Fix It !)
